# goodbadviz
Project 1 for Data Visualization Class

The purpose of Project 1 is to build your familiarity with the basics of d3.js and the web technologies it is built on, and to explore some of the basic design decisions (layout and encoding) in a data visualization.  The dataset to visualize will be the one that GLK recovered from the geometry of http://visual.ly/asics-running-and-injury-infographic
 
What to do: in bad.html you should make a bad visualization of data/asics.csv, and in good.html you should make a good visualization. The visualizations should be created using D3 inside the 800-by-500 svg element already in good.html and bad.html (to ensure that the same size browser window works to show everyone's work).  The visualizations should be static, and not require any keyboard or mouse interaction to view in their entirety (later projects will explore interactivity). Feel free to use ES6 for your javascript coding (insofar as Chrome supports it).  You should only modify and work within existing files; do not create new ones.
